Ashes
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mahmoud/ashes.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mahmoud/ashes)

[Dust](http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/) templating for Python 2 and 3.
Also the most convenient, portable, and powerful [command-line
templating utility](#command-line-interface).

A quick example:

```python
>>> from ashes import AshesEnv
>>> ashes_env = AshesEnv()

# Register/render from source

>>> ashes_env.register_source('hello', 'Hello, {name}!')
>>> ashes_env.render('hello', {'name': 'World'})
'Hello, World!'

# Or a file-based template (note: hella templates sold separately)

>>> ashes_env2 = AshesEnv(['./templates'])
>>> ashes_env2.render('hella.html', {'names': ['Kurt', 'Alex']})
'Hella Kurt and Alex!'
```

There's also built-in [bottle.py](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/)
support, which works exactly like bottle's own `template()` function
and `view()` decorator.

```python
from ashes import ashes_bottle_template as template
from ashes import ashes_bottle_view as view

@route('/')
def hello(name='World'):
    return template('bottle_hello_template', name=name)

@route('/dec')
@view('bottle_hello_template')
def hello_dec(name='World'):
    return {'name': name}

# Use debug=True to disable template caching for easier dev
run(host='localhost', port=8080, reloader=True, debug=True)
```

If you've read [bottle's template
docs](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html#templates), it'll be
even dead-simpler, believe it or not.

One last tip, use the `keep_whitespace` flag to determine whether or
not to optimize away whitespace in the rendered template. It's a good
idea to keep this disabled if you use JavaScript in your templated
files, because occasionally a single-line comment (i.e., `// ...` can
break your page.

```python
ashes_env = AshesEnv(keep_whitespace=False)  # optimize away whitespace
```

For more general information about the dust templating language, see
the [Dust documentation](http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/).


# Command-line interface

The ashes command-line interface serves two purposes. First, it makes
it easy to experiment with and test ashes features and behavior,
especially thanks to the inline "literal" options, demonstrated
below.

```sh
# using ashes to pretty-print JSON
$ python ashes.py --no-filter -T '{.|ppjson}' -M '{"x": {"y": [1,2,3]}}'
{
  "x": {
      "y": [
        1,
        2,
        3,
      ]
   }
}
```

Secondly, thanks to the compact, single-file implementation,
ashes can replace rusty sed and awk scripts, wherever Python 2.7-3.x
is available. Use ashes for generating shell scripts and much more.

Templates can be files or passed at the command line. Models, the
input data to the template, are passed in as JSON, either as a command
line option, or through stdin, enabling piping from web
requests. Several other options exist, see the help output below.

```
$ python ashes.py --help
Usage: ashes.py [options]

render a template using a JSON input

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --env-path=ENV_PATH   paths to search for templates, separate paths with :
  --filter=FILTER       autoescape values with this filter, defaults to 'h'
                        for HTML
  --no-filter           disables default HTML-escaping filter, overrides
                        --filter
  --trim-whitespace     removes whitespace on template load
  -m MODEL_PATH, --model=MODEL_PATH
                        path to the JSON model file, default - for stdin
  -M MODEL_LITERAL, --model-literal=MODEL_LITERAL
                        the literal string of the JSON model, overrides model
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output=OUTPUT_PATH
                        path to the output file, default - for stdout
  --output-encoding=OUTPUT_ENCODING
                        encoding for the output, default utf-8
  -t TEMPLATE_PATH, --template=TEMPLATE_PATH
                        path of template to render, absolute or relative to
                        env-path
  -T TEMPLATE_LITERAL, --template-literal=TEMPLATE_LITERAL
                        the literal string of the template, overrides template
  --verbose=VERBOSE     emit extra output on stderr
```

On systems with `ashes` installed, this interface is accessible
through the `ashes` command.

```
$ ashes --trim-whitespace --no-filter --template script.sh.dust --model data.json --output script.sh
```

## Installation

Ashes is implemented as a single .py file, so installation can be as
easy as downloading `ashes.py` above and putting it in the same
directory as your project.

And as always, `pip install ashes`. Installing the package has the
added benefit of installing the `ashes` command.

## Testimonials

Ashes is currently used in production settings at PayPal and Rackspace.

Additionally, it is part of
[the Clastic web framework](https://github.com/mahmoud/clastic) and
used [in several Wikimedia-oriented projects](https://github.com/hatnote).

If your company or project uses Ashes, feel free to submit an issue or
pull request to get a link or shoutout added to this section.

## Advanced Template Caching

The javascript implementation of Dust supports a form of template caching in
which the templates are pre-generated into code objects and then cached.  This
is necessary in javascript, because the templates would otherwise be loaded and
compiled on each pageview.

Most Ashes users will not need to use Template Caching, but it is supported
through hooks at several distinct stages:

* caching/loading the template's AST
* caching/loading the template's generated python function (as a string)
* caching/loading the template's generated python function (as a code object)
* caching/loading the template's generated python function (as a function)

There are many different benefits and concerns to caching templates at these
stages.  To explain this, let's assume that Ashes is being used to render
content that is correlated from 10 inter-dependent templates in a directory.

The standard way for rendering this would be to create a new Ashes "Loader" for
the directory and render it.  Ashes would then load and compile all 10 templates
as needed and re-use them throughout the life of the application.  This works
for most situations, because the Ashes rendering Environment and Template
Loader are usually created once and are persistent objects. 

This is our "Baseline" rendering situation, as Ashes must perform all
of the following steps -- which are the most expensive portions of templating:

* LOAD the Template
** Load the file
* COMPILE the Template
** Parse the contents into an AST
** Convert the AST into a Python function string
** Compile the Python string into a code object
** Exec the code object into a function
* RENDER the Template

The fastest part of Ashes is simply executing the template to render the
content -- this is usually less than 5% of the overall work!

In certain situations, the Ashes Environment or Template Loaders can not be
persistent.  This will happen if we have a lot of templates in a multi-tenant 
application and need to constrain the size of our templating environment 
(like a LRU cache), or need to limit the environment/loader to a very short
lifespan.  In these situations, hooking into Ashes to generate or load 
(partially) compiled templates is necessary t o overcome bottlenecks.

* ``Template.to_ast``/``Template.from_ast``.  These methods of the ``Template``
class will allow templates to be cached in their native AST format.  On average,
this will save about 35% of Ashes overhead vs the baseline performance. Data in 
this format is extremely safe to cache, because it is merely pre-processed. 

* ``Template.to_python_string``/``Template.from_python_string``.  These methods
of the ``Template`` class will allow templates to be cached as the Python
functions that Ashes generates.  These strings can be cached as-is.  
This is an efficient way to cache the data - depending on the templates this will
save around 65-80 % of the overhead.
Note: Data in this format is not necessarily safe to cache externally, because
it will be compiled and run through `exec`.  If your cache is compromised,
arbitrary code can be executed.

* ``Template.to_python_code``/``Template.from_python_code``.  These methods
of the ``Template`` class will allow templates to be cached as the Python
code objects that Ashes generates.  Python code objects can be (de)serialized
using the `marshal` package in the standard library.  This is the most efficient
way to cache the data - depending on the templates this will save around
92-94% of the overhead. 
Note: Data in this format is not necessarily safe to cache externally, because
it will be run through `exec`.  If your cache is compromised,
arbitrary code can be executed.

* ``Template.to_python_func``/``Template.from_python_func``.  This allows you
to pregenerate and cache (within a process) the python functions that Ashes
generates for each template.  This is an unbelievably efficient way to cache
the data - Ashes will only be rendering the templates, saving around 95-98% of
the overhead from the baseline version.

* ``ashes.python_string_to_code`` generates a python code object from an ashes
python code string.

* ``ashes.python_string_to_function`` generates a python function from an ashes
python code string.

The ``Template.__init__`` method also accepts keyword arguments for each of
these hooks:

* ``source_ast``
* ``source_python_string``
* ``source_python_code``
* ``source_python_func``


A very easy way to implement this is with a custom TemplateLoader.  Template 
Loaders are a flexible framework that can be used to precompile families of
templates or even lazily preload them as needed.

Detailed examples are provided in the tests.

If a custom loader is not used, the template must be registered with the active
ashes environment:

    ashesEnv = ashes.AshesEnv(loaders=(ashesLoader, ))
	templateObj = ashes.Template('apples.dust',
								 None,  # source
								 source_ast=source_ast,
								 source_python_string=source_python_string,
								 source_python_code=source_python_code,
								 source_python_func=source_python_func,
								 )
    ashesEnv.register(templateObj,
                      name="apples.dust",
                      )

### Recap

```
| method              | cacheable in process | cacheable external        | overhead | 
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------- |
| baseline (standard) | -                    | -                         | 100%     |
| ast                 | Yes                  | Safe                      | 65%      |
| python string       | Yes                  | Possible Security Risk    | 20-35%   |
| python code         | Yes                  | Same Risk, must `marshal` | 6-8%     |
| python func         | Yes                  | -                         | 3%       |
```

## Compatibility

```

(NOTE: Optimization is fairly straightforward, so only two of the more
complex examples are tested.)

### A word on functions

Of course, being a Python library, functions and callable items in the
contexts intended for server-side rendering must be written in
Python. However, there are three reasons this is desirable:

   1. Many context functions control some element of UI, such as
   a transition or delay, which would just waste cycles if executed
   server-side. (e.g., 'Intro' on the dust.js docs above)
   2. One-off context functions should be extremely basic, or
   3. Common, complex functions should be refactored into Helpers
   and registered in the rendering environment for all templates
   to use.

At the end of the day, though, remember that Dust is meant to be
data-driven, and if one finds oneself with highly complex functions in
the rendering contexts, one would do well to explore other templating
solutions.

### Other notes on compatibility

* Ashes uses a different parsing mechanism than dust, so on a few
rare corner cases, like comments placed within string literals, the
template behavior might differ.

Ashes has been tested extensively on Python 2.7, as well as 2.6, 3.2,
3.3, and PyPy.


## Things to watch out for

* Accidentally passing functions in as values to a
  template. Dust/Ashes calls all functions referenced by the
  template. If the function isn't of the right signature, you may see
  a TypeError.

* Leaving optimization enabled, especially when JavaScript is embedded
  in the page. Dust-style optimization is meant for HTML/XML and is
  nowhere near as smart as JavaScript/CSS minification suites. For
  example, a mixed-mode page (HTML/JS/CSS all in one page) may appear
  to work fine until the addition of a '//' single-line comment. When
  Dust/Ashes turns this into a single line, the page from that point
  on is treated as one long comment.
